# AdvisorAI

AdvisorAI is a work and learning planner tool in development, designed to interactively help users plan their learning paths. The user will tell AdvisorAI the topic of what they want to learn, their time commitment and what kind of resources they are interested in. The plan is to use a specialized prompt for OpenAI's API and inject the user input into the prompt. The response will provide a formulated work plan catered to the user's input.
